\begin{itemize}
\item
String intensive programs are abundant,
and analyzing them naively in a symbolic execution framework
is hard: string library code is analyzed as a bundle with
application code, spawning a huge amount of irrelevent states. 
\item
String SMT solvers allow a direct encoding of string library
code to SMT formulae, thus reducing dramatically the number
of explored states.
\item
Several string solvers exist:
\href{https://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun/issta54-kiezun.pdf}{Hampi},
\href{http://webblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/2010/kudzu/kudzu.pdf}{Kaluza},
\href{https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/33b1/576783490f94fe28f40570d6bf396f6369a4.pdf}{Pisa},
\href{http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~bultan/publications/tacas10.pdf}{Stranger}
\href{https://github.com/OrenGitHub/klee/issues/22}{CVC4},
\href{https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~joxan/papers/S3.pdf}{S3},
\href{https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~vganesh/Publications_files/vg2017-Z3str3-FMCAD2017.pdf}{Z3str3},
and they have been used (to some extent) to analyze SQL querries and
programs in Java, JavaScript and PHP.

C to Z3 transformations, like these examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item
while (tmp[0] == 'A' $||$ tmp[1] == 'B') $\{$tmp++;$\}$
\item
\href{https://github.com/OrenGitHub/klee/issues/22}{translated to Z3}
\item
do $\{$ $*$p = 0; p++; i++; $\}$ while (i $<$ len);
\item
\href{https://github.com/OrenGitHub/klee/issues/23}{translated to Z3}
\end{itemize}
\item
C to C under approximations of execution flow:
\begin{itemize}
\item
for (i = 0; i $<$ len; i++) \\
~ ~ ~ ~if ('A' $\leq$ p[i] $\leq$ 'Z') $\{$ p[i] = p[i] + 32; $\}$
\item
\href{https://github.com/OrenGitHub/klee/issues/25}{replacing with: nop+string constraints will help here}
\item
if (fiLong $\neq$ NULL) $\{$ \\
~ ~ ~ ~fi = strrchr (fiLong, '/');\\
~ ~ ~ ~if (fi == NULL) $\{$ fi = strrchr (fiLong, '\textbackslash \textbackslash'); $\}$ \\
~ ~ ~ ~if (fi $\neq$ NULL) $\{$ fi++;        $\}$ \\
~ ~ ~ ~if (fi   ==   NULL) $\{$ fi = fiLong; $\}\}$ \\
\item
Replacing with: fi=fiLong+string constraints will help.
\end{itemize}
\item
Improve reads/writes with caching / reduction of versions
\item
