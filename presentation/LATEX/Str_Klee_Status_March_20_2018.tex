str.klee is gradually becoming more stable.
\item
A multitude of artificial examples supports str.klee
\item
The following four (previously known) CVEs are discovered:

\begin{itemize}
\item
C to C transformations, like \href{https://github.com/OrenGitHub/klee/issues/24}{this example}
\item
C to Z3 transformations, like these examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item
while (tmp[0] == 'A' $||$ tmp[1] == 'B') $\{$tmp++;$\}$
\item
\href{https://github.com/OrenGitHub/klee/issues/22}{translated to Z3}
\item
do $\{$ $*$p = 0; p++; i++; $\}$ while (i $<$ len);
\item
\href{https://github.com/OrenGitHub/klee/issues/23}{translated to Z3}
\end{itemize}
\item
C to C under approximations of execution flow:
\begin{itemize}
\item
for (i = 0; i $<$ len; i++) \\
~ ~ ~ ~if ('A' $\leq$ p[i] $\leq$ 'Z') $\{$ p[i] = p[i] + 32; $\}$
\item
\href{https://github.com/OrenGitHub/klee/issues/25}{replacing with: nop+string constraints will help here}
\item
if (fiLong $\neq$ NULL) $\{$ \\
~ ~ ~ ~fi = strrchr (fiLong, '/');\\
~ ~ ~ ~if (fi == NULL) $\{$ fi = strrchr (fiLong, '\textbackslash \textbackslash'); $\}$ \\
~ ~ ~ ~if (fi $\neq$ NULL) $\{$ fi++;        $\}$ \\
~ ~ ~ ~if (fi   ==   NULL) $\{$ fi = fiLong; $\}\}$ \\
\item
Replacing with: fi=fiLong+string constraints will help.
\end{itemize}
\item
Improve reads/writes with caching / reduction of versions
\item
Context aware sorts in SE
